In the Omni-navigator VR travel scheme the user imagines that he/she is
holding a paper airplane or bird in oneâ€™s hand, and how he/she positions and orients the bird determines
how the user will travel through the space. To use this travel scheme, the user begins by holding the VR interaction controller (wand)
at an initial origin/starting position and orientation. Then by pressing a designated button and moving the wand from that origin,
the distance, direction and orientation from the initial origin determines the direction, rate of translation (movement in location)
and rotation about all 3 axes (see picture below). For example, to move forward, the user presses a button and moves the wand forward.
The distance from the starting position of the wand determines the speed of movement.
To move upward, the user presses the button and moves upward. The distance from the starting position again determines the speed of movement.
To pitch, yaw, or roll, the user presses the button and tilts the wand in one or more of the 3 axes. The greater the angle of tilt the more rapid the rotation. 

This travel scheme has the advantage that with only the use of one button and the position and orientation of the wand, the user can achieve
full 6-degree of freedom movement in addition to rate of movement. Once mastered users typically find the degree of control unparalleled by any other
VR travel scheme. Of course, if desired, some degrees of movement can also be constrained.
For example, if one wanted to adapt this scheme to a first-person-shoot-style of movement along a
horizontal plane, one simply has to exclude vertical (Y axis) movement, pitching and rolling.

See pdf document for more details on how to use the scheme in your Unity VR project- in particular using Meta SDK Building Blocks.
