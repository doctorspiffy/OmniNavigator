The Omni-navigator is a VR travel scheme that uses one button and the position and orientation of the wand, to enable a user to achieve
full 6-degree of freedom movement in addition to rate of movement. Once mastered users typically find the degree of control unparalleled by any other
VR travel scheme. Of course, if desired, some degrees of movement can also be constrained.
For example, if one wanted to adapt this scheme to a first-person-shoot-style of movement along a
horizontal plane, one simply has to exclude vertical (Y axis) movement, pitching and rolling.
